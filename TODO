Sourcing of utils is brittle in case of bot installed and cloned version present
version number
local variables
if output is specified, don't prompt for backup dest for signed iso (signed only)
better traps
set up xdg_data_dirs for isos + configs (keys paths, mirrors...)
Poviders, specific key paths
